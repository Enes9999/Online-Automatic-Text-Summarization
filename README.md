Online Automatic Text Summarization is a web-based application that generates summaries automatically by compressing the input of the user. The user can modify the generated summary based on the compression rate and keyword search.
The system itself displays the number of the compressed text and suggests keywords.
Online Automatic Text Summarization allows the user to sign up for an account. For users that have an account, the generated summaries will be able to be saved to the user's history.
